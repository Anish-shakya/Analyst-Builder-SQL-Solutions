#### I have used T-SQL (MSSQL) for solutions but there are different options you can choose to solve questions at your own pace.
- **Note**: MSSQL tends to be more strict about data type compatibility, so we need to CAST the data type if we are performing calculations that include division or any sort of calculation whose outcome is in decimal.
- But if the data type of a column is already decimal then we continue without type-casting the column.
